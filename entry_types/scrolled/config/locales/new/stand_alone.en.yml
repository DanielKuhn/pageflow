            standAlone: "Stand alone"
          item_inline_help_texts:
            inline: |-
              Anchor in the text and scroll along with the rest of the
              section's content.
            sticky: |-
              Place beside the text while scrolling. In mobile view,
              sticky elements are automatically turned into inline
              elements. Sticky elements work particularly well in
              desktop view in combination with long text passages.
            standAlone: |-
              Briefly stay in the middle of the viewport while
              scrolling. This gives the reader a stable position to
              fully view the element. Smaller elements can be given
              more weight that way.
            left: |-
              Indent element on the left and let it be surrounded by the section's text.
            right: |-
              Indent element on the right and let it be surrounded by the section's text.
          inline_help: |-
            Control the position of the element in relation to
            surrounding text blocks.
