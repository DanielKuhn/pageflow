        position:

          inline_help: >
            This setting allows you to control the position of the element in relation to
            surrounding text blocks: the element can prominently stand alone ("Full Width"), it can
            be anchored within the text ("Inline") or it can be positioned adjacent to the text
            ("Sticky"). Sticky elements remain static in the middle of the viewport alongside the
            text until either the section is scrolled out of the viewport or until they get pushed
            upwards by the next sticky element of the section. On mobile devices sticky elements
            automatically get positioned inline. Sticky elements work particularly well on desktop
            devices in combination with long texts.
          values:
            inline: Inline
            full: Full Width

              In case of background images you can specify the main image motif area. This area will

              devices.
