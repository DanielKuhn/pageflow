            Drag the slider to change the width of the element. Wider
            elements interrupt the text flow and stand prominently on
            their own.
        position:
          inline_help: |-
            This setting allows you to control the position of the
            element in relation to surrounding text blocks: it can be
            anchored within the text ("Inline") or positioned adjacent
            to the text ("Sticky"). Sticky elements remain static in
            the middle of the viewport alongside the text until either
            the section is scrolled out of the viewport or they get
            pushed upwards by the next sticky element of the
            section. On mobile devices sticky elements automatically
            get positioned inline. Sticky elements work particularly
            well on desktop devices in combination with long texts.

          # Content Elements

          In each section, any number of content elements can be
          inserted and positioned against a background. The position
          of the content elements on wide screen aspect ratios is
          determined by the foreground **positioning of the section**
          (left, right, center). In portrait mode on smartphones
          (upright) the content elements are always displayed one
          below the other for space reasons.

          To add a new content element, click on the **plus button**
          above or below an existing one and then insert text blocks,
          media, embeds or external links.

          Click on a content element to select it. The sidebar then
          displays options for **positioning the content element** and
          other options, such as activating **autoplay for audio and
          video**.

          For display on wide screen aspect ratios (desktop, notebook,
          tablet, smartphone landscape), individual content elements
          such as videos, audios, video embeds, 360Â° images can also
          be arranged separately from the text flow as **sticky**
          elements. Sticky elements remain static in the middle of the
          viewport alongside the text until either the section is
          scrolled out of the viewport or they get pushed upwards by
          the next sticky element of the section.

          If a section is aligned centrally, content elements can also
          be **indented to the left or right**. In this case, the
          content element is reduced in size so that the text can be
          displayed next to, instead of below the content element."
